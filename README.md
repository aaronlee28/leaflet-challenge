# leaflet-challenge

This project uses United States Geological Survey (USGS), which responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems, the environment, the impacts of climate, and land-use change. 

The goal of this project is to build a new set of tools that will visualize the earthquake data, taken from the USGS official website in a form of JSON. 

The map is created using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude. Data markers are reflecting the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquake with higher magnitudes appears larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

Popups are also included that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is hovered over.

Legends are provided on the bottom right of the map, which provides context for the map data.
